# tweet-graph

The idea is to make an api that transform the tweet information of a user to
network of graphs. 

The main use is (ie.): 

    python main.py --user vm_rod25

After that you can generate the graph as: 

    python graph_generator.py

( Take into consideration that you need to have 
just the csv that you want to plot )
